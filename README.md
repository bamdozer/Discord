Discord Timeseries for the top 8 people to prevent clutter.

Click on the download rawfile under w2exp_progression_over_time.html to interact and see how exp changes over time.

This does NOT update in real time. 
This was created by ChatGPT reading the images of the EXP list and formatting it an excel file. T/D - NAME - EXP
Then I created a small python code to make the excel sheet into time series that can be interacted with.  
Just really thought it would be something to look at, and play around with. 
To update the time series all i need is screenshot of the EXP chart and the code updates!

- maybe later there could be plugin to do most of it for me atleast the updating part. This was more a proof of cocncept!
